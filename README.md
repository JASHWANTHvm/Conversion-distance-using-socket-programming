# Conversion-distance-using-socket-programming

# Socket Programming for real-time data exchange.
  - To create a distance conversion tool that allows users to input a distance and convert it to various units, using real-time client-server communication.
  - TCP/UDP Protocols for reliable (TCP) and fast (UDP) communication.
  - Web Technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for a user-friendly interface.

# TCP Socket
# TCP Socket Setup:
  - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides a reliable, ordered communication channel.
# How TCP Works:
  - Establishes a connection, then sends data in a sequence to ensure reliability.
# In This Project:
  - TCP is used to establish a stable connection between client and server, ensuring conversion requests are received and processed accurately.

# UDP Socket
# UDP Socket Setup:
   - UDP (User Datagram Protocol) allows for faster, connectionless communication.
# How UDP Works:
   - Sends data packets without establishing a connection, reducing latency.
# In This Project:
   - UDP is used to handle quick, individual conversion requests without the need for connection establishment.
